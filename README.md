# Beekin Full Stack Case Study

## Project Description

The Beekin Full Stack Case Study aims to address a common issue in the hiring process by providing a platform where users can browse job openings, view detailed job information, and apply for positions. This project consists of a backend system that provides job listings and a frontend application that allows users to interact with these listings.

## Problem Statement

In the hiring process, ensuring that candidates possess the skills and experience mentioned in their CVs and can deliver expected results after hiring is a challenge.
